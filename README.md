# Forge Space Batch Florence-2
This is a Space for the [Forge Webui](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge), based on the built-in [Florence-2](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/tree/main/extensions-builtin/forge_space_florence_2) Space, but modified to work for batches from a folder instead.
